# CITATION Files

In 2013 Owen Wilson, Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, published a simple but effective idea:

```
Put a plaintext file named CITATION in the root directory of your code, and put information in it about how to cite your software. Go on, do it now – it’ll only take two minutes!
```

His [original article](http://blog.rtwilson.com/encouraging-citation-of-software-introducing-citation-files/) was subsequently [republished on the blog of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-06-encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files) and cited in the Software Citation Principles paper.

We suggest you use CITATION files in your own work. Perhaps you'll use it to suggest that people cite the DOI created for your software by Zenodo?
