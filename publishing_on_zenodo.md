# Publishing from a GitHub repository to Zenodo

It is good practice to develop your software on Github (as demonstrated elsewhere in this workshop).
Additionally, once your code is in GitHub, it is straightforward to publish it on Zenodo.
We will learn how to do this in this section.

## Creating something to publish

If you have not yet worked through the other sessions of this workshop, you may not have anything on GitHub to publish.
If this is the case, we'll quickly create something now.

If you already have a project on GitHub, you may skip this step.
