# Code publication and citation

Software is a vital part of modern research and yet there is currently little support for its acknowledgement and citation.
In this workshop, we will introduce the recently published **Software Citation Principles** as developed by a [Force 11](https://www.force11.org/) working group.
We will also introduce [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a service developed by [CERN](https://home.cern/), that allows us to publish research objects such as scripts, data and software packages in a way that satisfies the software citation principles.

* [The Software Citation Principles](software_citation.md) - A summary of the software citation guidelines we'll be implementing in this tutorial.

## Publishing your software

* [What software should we publish?](what_to_publish.md)
* [Where can we publish our software?](where_to_publish.md)
* [Creating a Zenodo account](zenodo.md)
* [Publishing a GitHub repository to Zenodo](publishing_on_zenodo.md)

## Citing Software

Just as it is important to publish our own research software, it is also important for us to cite the software of others who we rely on for our research. The [software citation principals paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/) contains a detailed discussion of this issue but for the purposes of this workshop, we would like to draw your attention to the following.

* [R's citation function](R_citation.md)
* [CITATION Files](CITATION.md)

## Things we haven't told you

The world of Research Software Engineering is moving very quickly. Here are links to resources you may be interested in.

* Your university library may have a Research Data Management repository that can be used to publish software in the same way that Zenodo can. For example, The University of Sheffield has recently (late 2016) released ORDA - a system based on Figshare: https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/rdm/orda
* [Depsy](http://depsy.org/) attempts to gather metrics on software published in major repositories such as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
* [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) is attempting to build an archive of archives!

In order to make your software more discoverable and easier to use, you may choose to invest more time in producing fully-fledged package in a repository such as CRAN. How to do this is outside the scope of this tutorial
