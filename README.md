# Code publication and citation

Software is a vital part of modern research and yet there is currently little support for its acknowledgement and citation.
In this workshop, we will introduce the recently published **Software Citation Principles** as developed by a [Force 11](https://www.force11.org/) working group.
We will also introduce [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a service developed by [CERN](https://home.cern/), that allows us to publish research objects such as scripts, data and software packages in a way that satisfies the software citation principles.

* [The Software Citation Principles](software_citation.md) - A summary of the software citation guidelines we'll be implementing in this tutorial.

## Publishing your software

* [What software should we publish?](what_to_publish.md)
* [Where can we publish our software?](where_to_publish.md)
* [Creating a Zenodo account](zenodo.md)
* [Publishing a GitHub repository to Zenodo](publishing_on_zenodo.md)

## Citing Software

Just as it is important to publish our own research software, it is also important for us to cite the software of others who we rely on for our research. The [software citation principals paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/) contains a detailed discussion of this issue but for the purposes of this workshop, we would like to draw your attention to the following.

* [R's citation function](R_citation.md)
* CITATION Files
