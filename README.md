# Code publication and citation

Software is a vital part of modern research and yet there is currently little support for its acknowledgement and citation.
In this workshop, we will introduce the recently published **Software Citation Principles** as developed by a [Force 11](https://www.force11.org/) working group.
We will also introduce [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a service developed by [CERN](https://home.cern/), that allows us to publish research objects such as scripts, data and software packages in a way that satisfies the software citation principles.
